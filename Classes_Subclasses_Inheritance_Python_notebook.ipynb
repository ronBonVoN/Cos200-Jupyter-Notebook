    "### Some notes about inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to reuse the logic of an existing class. Since the subclass inherits attributes and methods of its superclass, you can use the instance of the subclass as if it were an instance of the superclass. While this notebook contains examples of single inheritance (subclasses inherit only from a single class), Python supports [multiple inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-inheritance-python/), in which subclasses can inherit from more than one class. (Java does not allow this!) <br><br>\n",
    "In Python3, all classes are descendants of the ```object``` class, except for exceptions, which all descend from [a ```BaseExceptions``` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html). The ```object``` class is what provides common methods such as ```__init__```, ```__str__```, ```__repr__```, and quite a few others. Child classes can (and do) override these methods. <br>"
